# Inspect HTML  (Pico CTF)
## Difficulty - Easy
## Approach
### Step 1 — Initial Observation

After opening the challenge link, the webpage appeared simple with no visible input fields, links, or clues.

### Step 2 — Inspecting the HTML

Because of the challenge name (Inspect HTML), I opened Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or right-click → Inspect) and examined the source code.

I expanded the <html> and <body> sections to look for hidden elements or comments.

### Step 3 — Finding the Flag

Inside the <body> tag, I found a hidden HTML comment containing the flag:
<!-- picoCTF{hidden_flag_here} -->
![Flag](CTF_Writeups/Web Exploitation/Inspect HTML/flag.png)
### Step 4 — Submitting the Flag

Copied the flag and submitted it to the PicoCTF portal. The submission was accepted successfully.

### Key Takeaways

Challenge titles often give strong hints toward the intended solution method.

Inspecting the HTML structure is a fundamental yet crucial skill in web exploitation challenges.

Always explore the page source before trying complex tools.
